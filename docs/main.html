bgcolor="#EEEEFF"> <b>ProGuard</b> is a free Java class file shrinker and
obfuscator. It can detect and remove unused classes, fields, methods, and
attributes. It can then rename the remaining classes, fields, and methods
using short meaningless names. The resulting jars are more compact and more
difficult to reverse-engineer. </td></tr></table>
<p>
More compact jar files also means smaller storage requirements, faster
transfer of applets across networks, faster loading, and smaller memory
footprints.
<p>
Advantages of <b>ProGuard</b> compared to other Java obfuscators are compact
template-based configuration, memory efficiency, and speed:
<ul>
<li><b>ProGuard</b> is configured using intuitive command line options or
    configuration files. For instance, the following configuration option
    preserves all applets in a jar:
<pre>
  -keep public class * extends java.applet.Applet
</pre>
    The user manual explains all available options and shows more examples of
    this powerful configuration style.
<p>
<li><b>ProGuard</b> only takes a few minutes to process programs and libraries
    of several megabytes. The results section presents actual figures for a
    number of applications.
</ul>
