<b>Proguard</b> grew out of <b>RetroGuard</b>, which its author Mark Welch has
kindly made available under the GNU Lesser General Public License.
<b>RetroGuard</b> is a very nice piece of code, but it only performs
obfuscation. I started from the class file parsing code and wrote my own
shrinker and obfuscator, heavily using the visitor pattern.
<p>

Development was done on equipment of my employer <a
href="http://www.luciad.com/" target="other">Luciad</a>, a great Java GIS
company with friendly people.
<p>

The project is hosted at <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/projects/proguard/"
target="other">SourceForge</a>.
<p>

My colleagues at Luciad have been very patient working with early versions of
the code. Since the first public release, others have chimed in with
interesting ideas, bug reports, and bug fixes: Thorsten Heit, Oliver Retzl,
Jonathan Knudsen, Bob Drury, Dave Jarvis, Marc Chapman, Dave Morehouse, and
Richard Osbaldeston. Thanks! Your feedback has been invaluable.
<p>

The code and these web pages were written using Sun JDK 1.3.1, Borland
JBuilder, IntelliJ IDEA, GNU emacs, bash, sed, awk, and a whole host of other
free tools which continue to make programming interesting.
