<h3>Problems while processing</h3>

ProGuard may print out some notes and non-fatal warnings:
<ul>
<li>If your code contains <b>class casts of dynamically created class
    instances</b>, like
    "<code>(MyClass)Class.forName(variable).newInstance()</code>", ProGuard
    will list them. Depending on your application, you may need to keep the
    mentioned classes with an option like "<code>-keep class MyClass</code>",
    or their implementations with an option like "<code>-keep class *
    implements MyClass</code>". You can switch off these notes by specifying
    the <code>-dontnote</code> option.
    <p>

<li>If you get a warning about <b>duplicate input classes</b>, your input jars
    or library jars contain multiple definitions of the same class. ProGuard
    continues processing as usual, only considering the first definition. The
    warning may be an indication of some problem though, so it's advisable to
    remove the duplicates. There is no option to switch off these warnings.
    <p>

<li>If you get a warning about <b>duplicate resource files or zip entries</b>,
    your input jars or resource jars contain multiple resource files with the
    same name. ProGuard continues copying the resource files as usual,
    skipping any files with previously used names. Once more, the warning may
    be an indication of some problem though, so it's advisable to remove the
    duplicates. There is no option to switch off these warnings.

</ul>
<p>

ProGuard may terminate when it encounters parsing errors or I/O errors, or
some more serious warnings:
<ul>
<li>If you get an error message about <b>missing <code>-keep</code>
    options</b>, you either forgot them or you mistyped the class names.
    ProGuard has to know exactly what you want to keep: an application, an
    applet, a servlet, a midlet,..., or any combination of these. Without the
    proper seed specifications, ProGuard would mark all class files as unused,
    and your output jar would be empty.
    <p>

<li>If there are <b>unresolved references to superclasses or interfaces</b>,
    you most likely forgot to specify an essential library. At least the Java
    run-time library should be specified. Furthermore, all libraries with
    classes or interfaces that are extended or implemented by classes in your
    input jars should be specified. For specifying libraries, use the
    <code>-libraryjars</code> option.
    <p>
    If the class that is reported as missing is a non-public library class,
    you should specify the <code>-dontskipnonpubliclibraryclasses</code>
    option.
    <p>
    If you're missing a library and you're absolutely sure it isn't used
    anyway, you can try your luck with the <code>-ignorewarnings</code>
    option, or even the <code>-dontwarn</code> option.
    <p>

<li>If there are <b>unresolved references to class members in input
    classes</b>, your class files are most likely inconsistent. Possibly, some
    class file didn't get recompiled properly, or some class file was left
    behind after its source file was removed. Try removing all class files,
    recompiling them, zipping them up, and running ProGuard again.

</ul>
<p>

Should ProGuard crash while processing your application:
<ul>
<li>Maybe your class files are corrupt. See if recompiling them and trying
    again helps. If not, please contact me, at least reporting the version of
    your JDK, the version of ProGuard, the options, and the printed output,
    including exception stack trace (use the <code>-verbose</code> option).
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Problems at run-time</h3>

If ProGuard runs fine, but your processed application doesn't work, there
might be several reasons:
<ul>

<li>If it looks like <b>a whole bunch of classes has disappeared</b> from your
    output jar, you may have unpacked the output jar on a platform with a
    case-insensitive file system, such as Windows. Unpacking tools often let
    class files with similar lower-case and upper-case names overwrite each
    other. If you really have to unpack your jar and you can't switch to a
    different operating system, you could consider using ProGuard's
    <code>-dontusemixedcaseclassnames</code> option.
    <p>

<li>If you get a <code><b>NoClassDefFoundError</b></code>, your class path is
    probably incorrect. It should at least contain all library jars and, of
    course, your processed program jar.
    <p>

<li>If you get a <code><b>ClassNotFoundException</b></code>, your code is
    probably calling <code>Class.forName</code>, trying to create the missing
    class dynamically. ProGuard can only detect constant name arguments, like
    <code>Class.forName("mypackage.MyClass")</code>. For variable name
    arguments like <code>Class.forName(someClass)</code>, you have to keep all
    possible classes using the <code>-keep</code> option, e.g. "<code>-keep
    class mypackage.MyClass</code>" or "<code>-keep class * implements
    mypackage.MyInterface</code>".
    <p>

<li>If you get a <code><b>NoSuchMethodException</b></code>, your code is
    probably calling something like <code>myClass.getMethod</code>, trying to
    find some method dynamically. Since ProGuard isn't detecting this (yet),
    you have to keep the missing method in using the <code>-keep</code>
    option, e.g. "<code>-keep class mypackage.MyClass { void myMethod();
    }</code>".
    <p>

<li>If you get a <code><b>NullPointerException</b></code> or if you don't see
    any icons, your processed code may be unable to find some resource files.
    ProGuard currently simply copies resource files over from the input jars
    to the output jar. Their names and contents remain unchanged. If you've
    used the <code>-defaultpackage</code> option, the package names of some
    classes may have changed, and along with them, the directory in which they
    look for their resource files. It's better not to use this option in these
    circumstances.
    <p>

<li>If you get a <b>verification error</b> in J2ME, you may have forgotten to
    preverify your program jar <i>after</i> having processed it with ProGuard.
    <p>

<li>If you get a <code><b>NoSuchMethodError</b></code> or an
    <code><b>AbstractMethodError</b></code>, perhaps there's a bug in ProGuard
    (gasp!). If so, please contact me, preferably with the simplest example on
    which you can find ProGuard to fail.
