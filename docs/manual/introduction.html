<b>ProGuard</b> is a Java class file shrinker and obfuscator. It detects and
removes unused classes, fields, methods, and attributes, and it renames the
remaining classes, fields, and methods using short meaningless names. The
resulting jars are smaller and harder to reverse-engineer.
<p>
ProGuard can also be used to list unused fields and methods in an application,
and to print out the internal structure of class files.

ProGuard typically reads the <b>input jars</b> (or directories), shrinks their
class files, obfuscates the shrunk class files, and writes them to an output
jar (or directory). In order to determine which code has to be preserved,
which code can be discarded, and which code can be obfuscated, you have to
specify one or more seed classes or methods. These seeds are typically main
classes, applets, midlets,... In the shrinking phase, ProGuard recursively
determines which classes and class members are used, and discards the rest. In
the obfuscation phase, all classes and class members get new names, except for
the seeds, so they can still be called by their original names.
<p>
You can optionally specify <b>resource jars</b> (or directories). ProGuard
copies all non-class resource files from these jars to the output jar. Their
names and contents remain unchanged. If no resource jars are specified, the
input jars are used as resource jars.
<p>
ProGuard requires the <b>library jars</b> (or directories) of the input jars
to be specified, or at least the library jars containing classes that are
<i>extended</i> by input classes. The library jars themselves always remain
unchanged.
<p>
ProGuard automatically handles <code>Class.forName("SomeClass")</code> and
<code>SomeClass.class</code> constructs. The referenced classes are preserved
in the shrinking phase, and the string arguments are properly replaced in the
obfuscation phase. With variable string arguments, it's generally not possible
to determine their possible values (they might be read from a configuration
file, for instance). However, ProGuard will note constructs like
"<code>(SomeClass)Class.forName(variable).newInstance()</code>". These might
be an indication that the class or interface <code>SomeClass</code> and/or its
implementations may need to be preserved. The user can adapt his configuration
accordingly.
